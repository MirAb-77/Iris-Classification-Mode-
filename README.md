# The Iris Flower Data Set

The **Iris flower data set** or **Fisher's Iris data set** is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist **Ronald Fisher** in his 1936 paper *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems* as an example of linear discriminant analysis【[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set#:~:text=The%20Iris%20flower%20data%20set,example%20of%20linear%20discriminant%20analysis.)】. It is sometimes called **Anderson's Iris data set** because **Edgar Anderson** collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species【[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set#:~:text=The%20Iris%20flower%20data%20set,example%20of%20linear%20discriminant%20analysis.)】.

Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus"【[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set#:~:text=The%20Iris%20flower%20data%20set,example%20of%20linear%20discriminant%20analysis.)】. Fisher's paper was published in the journal, the **Annals of Eugenics**, creating controversy about the continued use of the Iris dataset for teaching statistical techniques today.

The data set consists of `150` records and `50` samples under 5 attributes from each of three species(Class) of Iris (`Iris setosa`, `Iris virginica` and `Iris versicolor`). Four features were measured from each sample: the `length` and the `width` of the `sepals` and `petals`, in centimeters(Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width). Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.You can download it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset).
